Filebeat is used to send Logs to elasticsearch and Kibana.
So, all docker container logs encoded in JSON will be decoded and visualized in Kibana.

Logs will be written in files by Docker. FileBeat then will have the task to read those logs from files 
and transfer them to ElasticSearch. So, here, Logstash won't be used and will be substituted by Filebeat 
as it requires less resources. 

A docker-compose file will be used for the setup with the Elasticsearch, Kibana, and Filbeat services.
The official docker images will be used.



All you have to do is the following:

1) In docker-compose.yml, for filebeat volumes :
   Make sure to change your work directory by a valid path on your computer for this to work.


2) In the directory containing the docker-compose.yml file, run the command:
   docker-compose up

 kibana can be accessed now in your web browser: http://localhost:5601

What you have to do is to configure the ElasticSearch indices that can be displayed in Kibana.
You can use the pattern filebeat-* to include all the logs coming from FileBeat.
Now, all the logs from FileBeat, ElasticSearch, Kibana and any other containers can be visualized in the Kibana interface.
